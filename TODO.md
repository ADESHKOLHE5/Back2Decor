# TODO List for Product Details Implementation

- [x] Edit ProductDetails.tsx: Import useParams, add rendering for product image and title, handle loading/error states.
- [x] Edit CardDesign.tsx: Import useNavigate, add onDoubleClick to the Card component to navigate to /shop/${product.id}.
- [x] Test double-click navigation and product details display. (Skipped by user)
- [x] Ensure proper error handling if product not found. (Handled in code)
